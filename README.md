# TriAttNet: Triple Attention Network for Image Super-Resolution
**Written by: Anthony Huang**
## Overview
![Description of image](Result/architecture.png)
TriAttNet is a cutting-edge image super-resolution model that integrates a novel **Triple Attention Mechanism**, which enhances image quality by learning complex dependencies across multiple dimensions. This model aims to push the boundaries of image resolution enhancement by combining three distinct types of attention: **Channel Attention**, **Spatial Attention**, and **Self-Attention**. By leveraging these mechanisms, TriAttNet can produce superior quality high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs, outperforming traditional methods that focus on only one aspect of the attention.

Our experiments, conducted as part of this project, showcase the modelâ€™s ability to effectively capture both local and global dependencies in images, providing more accurate and detailed results in real-world applications such as image restoration, medical imaging, and satellite imagery.

## Architecture

TriAttNet consists of a carefully crafted architecture that incorporates multiple deep learning techniques to enhance image resolution. Below are the core components of the model:

### 1. **Triple Attention Module**
   - **Channel Attention**: This mechanism captures the importance of each feature channel, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features for enhancing image resolution.
   - **Spatial Attention**: By applying convolutional layers, spatial attention allows the model to highlight important regions of the image, improving the ability to capture fine-grained details.
   - **Self-Attention**: A multi-head self-attention mechanism is employed to capture long-range dependencies, enabling the model to learn the global structure of the image. This is particularly useful in high-resolution tasks where long-range context is crucial.

### 2. **Residual Blocks**
   The residual blocks in TriAttNet help preserve the identity mapping, which allows the model to learn deeper features without the risk of vanishing gradients. Each block consists of:
   - Convolutional layers with **Batch Normalization**.
   - Activation functions (PReLU) to introduce non-linearity.
   - **Dropout** layers to prevent overfitting.

### 3. **Upsampling Layer**
   The model upscales the low-resolution input to a higher resolution (512x512) using **bilinear interpolation**, ensuring that the output image maintains smooth transitions and fine details. This upsampling process is essential for generating high-resolution outputs while preserving the integrity of the original features.

### 4. **Final Convolution Layer**
   The final convolution layer refines the enhanced image and applies a **Tanh** activation function, ensuring that the pixel values are within the range suitable for output.

### Experiment Insights
Throughout the experiments, we observed that incorporating the **Triple Attention Mechanism** allowed the model to significantly improve upon traditional convolutional-based super-resolution methods. The performance in terms of **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)** and **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)** was consistently higher, especially when applied to datasets with diverse image content.
